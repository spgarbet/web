Beginning a revamp of my website, once again. I saw [Nick Stryer](http://nickstrayer.me/)'s presentation today on how to simply put together a static website. I knew most of the parts and pieces, but the simplicity attracted me. Especially considering I have broken my Erlang site and have to invest some time to fix it. I'm going to write a Postgresql export from Zotonic and see how far I can get with that.

I think the really up side to all this, is a lot of my projects can just all get central hubbed through a static site. The github model of hosting is quite amazing for simple static sites.

Nick used a photo of him yawning as an example. I've posting that here as a tribute, and because once you've posted something like that to the internet it'll probably end up a poster in your retirement home.
